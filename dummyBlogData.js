      "Sorting algorithms are ways to organize an array of items from smallest to largest. These algorithms can be used to organize messy data and make it easier to use. Furthermore, having an understanding of these algorithms and how they work is fundamental for a strong understanding of Computer Science which is becoming more and more critical in a world of premade packages.",
